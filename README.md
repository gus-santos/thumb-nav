# Thumb Nav

Thumb Nav is an attempt to improve a mobile navbar, by putting all icons in a circle right under your thumb -- instead of a bar that will have you stretching to reach the farthest icons.

First upload is the simplest version possible, with clashing colours for contrast.

It's been deployed to <https://thumb-nav.herokuapp.com/>

## To do

- Add JS to move it around (and keep it there).
